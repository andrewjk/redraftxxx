# Redraft Cloudflare Template

🚧 WARNING: WORK IN PROGRESS 🚧

This is the source code for a [Redraft](https://github.com/andrewjk/redraft) template site that you can deploy to your Cloudflare account.

I think it should work with a free account...

Alternatively, you can pay for a hosted account at https://redraft.social for $4.99 per month. At any time, you can take your data and move to a self-hosted solution.

## You will need

- A GitHub account
- A Cloudflare account

## Setup

### Create the site

Hit the button below. It should clone a site into your GitHub account, prompt you to configure project details, and build and deploy the Worker site.

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fandrewjk%2Fredraft-template-cf)

### Set up your account

- Go to `SITE_LOCATION/account/setup` to create your account

### Keep it up to date

- Regularly run `npm update` and `npm deploy`
